            <td>I secured and led an NLM-funded R01 (at OHSU) focused on information retrieval.  I also had an NIAID-funded R21 (with Mayo Clinic) on aggregating patient information over time. There are some foundational interests that guide how I think about these problems:
            <ul><li>
                Computational semantics.  I am interested in distributional/geometric models of semantics and in ontological semantics.  Each type of representation may provide complementary benefits in NLP applications.  I am also interested in compositionality and similarity in these semantic frameworks.

            </li>
            <li>
                Clinical information extraction/retrieval.  Much of the important information in electronic medical records (EMR) is in free-text clinical notes rather than form fields.  With clinical NLP, this information may be accessed and used to improve patient care.  I am also interested in implementing the systems that make  this information available to clinicians and researchers, hence my interest in information retrieval.
